`dataui` brings the beautiful interactive visualizations of [`data-ui`](https://williaster.github.io/data-ui) based on [`vx`](https://vx-demo.now.sh/) to **R**.  Currently the package nearly fully supports [`sparkline`](https://williaster.github.io/data-ui/?selectedKind=sparkline&selectedStory=Kitchen%20sink&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0) and [`histogram`](https://williaster.github.io/data-ui/?selectedKind=histogram&selectedStory=Playground&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0), and no you do **not** need to know `React`.  You will be writing `React` without even knowing it.

Yes, I know `data-ui` is in [repo freeze](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui#repo-freeze-), but I could not wait for [#201](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui/issues/201).  The author, now also on the `vx` team, has done an incredible job, so I am willing (slightly crazy) to invest the time to write this package.  Plus, I sort of "need" it for a live project.

## Help

I would love for you to join me on the journey, and I will make sure that this is a friendly and welcoming place.  If money is more abundant than time for you, then let me know as well.

## Installation

Far from CRAN-worthy but hopefully there eventually, `remotes::install_github()` for now.

``` r
remotes::install_github("timelyportfolio/dataui")
```

## Example

I was able to nearly fully replicate all the `data-ui` sparkline examples.  See the [vignette]().
