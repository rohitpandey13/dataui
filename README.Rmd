`dataui` brings the beautiful interactive visualizations of [`data-ui`](https://williaster.github.io/data-ui) based on [`vx`](https://vx-demo.now.sh/) to **R**.  Currently the package nearly fully supports [`sparkline`](https://williaster.github.io/data-ui/?selectedKind=sparkline&selectedStory=Kitchen%20sink&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0) and [`histogram`](https://williaster.github.io/data-ui/?selectedKind=histogram&selectedStory=Playground&full=0&addons=0&stories=1&panelRight=0), and no you do **not** need to know `React`.  You will be writing `React` without even knowing it.

Yes, I know `data-ui` is in [repo freeze](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui#repo-freeze-), but I could not wait for [#201](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui/issues/201).  The author, now also on the `vx` team, has done an incredible job, so I am willing (slightly crazy) to invest the time to write this package.  Plus, I sort of "need" it for a live project.  Our other  [sparkline](https://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-about) in R is a little old and tired (but I still very much appreciate the library) and has been frozen/unmaintained for many years.

## Help

I would love for you to join me on the journey, and I will make sure that this is a friendly and welcoming place.  If money is more abundant than time for you, then let me know as well.  

## Installation

Far from CRAN-worthy but hopefully there eventually, `remotes::install_github()` for now.

``` r
remotes::install_github("timelyportfolio/dataui")
```

## Example


#### Sparkines 

This is is the shortest code example I could create.

```
library(dataui)
dui_sparkline(
  data = rnorm(50),
  components = list(dui_sparklineseries())
)
```

I was able to nearly fully replicate all the `data-ui` sparkline examples.  See the [vignette](https://timelyportfolio.github.io/dataui/articles/dataui_replicate_examples.html).

#### Histogram

Currently there are some examples in [experiments.R](https://github.com/timelyportfolio/dataui/blob/master/inst/examples/experiments.R).  I should also note that `dataui` histograms also work very well as sparklines.

Below is a quick example.

```
library(dataui)

rn <- rnorm(1000)
ri <- runif(1000)

dui_histogram(
  binCount = 25,
  components = list(
    dui_barseries(rawData = rn, fill="#000"),
    dui_densityseries(rawData = rn, stroke = "#000"),
    dui_barseries(rawData = ri),
    dui_densityseries(rawData = ri),
    dui_xaxis(),
    dui_yaxis()
  )
)
```

#### reactable

And thanks to the fine work of Greg Lin, `dataui` just works with [`reactable`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/).  I would still like to tighten up the integration though, since the data gets duplicated in multiple spots.  Here is a quick example to prove it.  `dataui` should also work relatively well with other `R` table libraries.

```
library(dataui)
library(dplyr)
library(reactable)

data <- chickwts %>%
  group_by(feed) %>%
  summarise(weight = list(weight))

binValues = hist(chickwts$weight, breaks=15, plot = FALSE)$breaks

fillColors = scales::brewer_pal(type="qual", palette="Set2")(8)

reactable(
  data,
  columns = list(
    feed = colDef(maxWidth = 100),
    weight = colDef(
      minWidth = 400,
      cell = function(values, index) {
        dui_histogram(
          height = 200,
          width = 400,
          binValues = binValues,
          renderTooltip = htmlwidgets::JS(reactR::babel_transform("
{({ event, datum, data, color }) => (
  <div>
    <strong style={{ color }}>{datum.bin0} to {datum.bin1}</strong>
    <div><strong>count </strong>{datum.count}</div>
    <div><strong>cumulative </strong>{datum.cumulative.toFixed(0)}</div>
    <div><strong>density </strong>{datum.density.toFixed(0)}</div>
  </div>
)}
          ")),
          components = list(
            dui_barseries(rawData = values, fill = fillColors[index]),
            dui_densityseries(rawData = values, stroke = fillColors[index], fill = fillColors[index]),
            dui_xaxis()
          )
        )
      }
    )
  ),
  width = 600
)

```

If you use `dataui` in the wild, let me know and I will save a spot here for you.
